# Javascript Brainfuck Interpreter / Debugger

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> is an esoteric toy programming language 
which can be used to teach some software engineering principals, but is mostly used to produce very 
complex-looking programs that do very simple things.

This project is a web-based debugger for Brainfuck, created in 2002 when the world was young.

You can play with it online at <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/misc/bf_debug/">http://www.iamcal.com/misc/bf_debug/</a>
